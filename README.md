# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm currently diving into the world of **data science**, learning by building projects that cover the **entire data lifecycle**

## ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On

- Choosing the right **machine learning models** based on the data
- Cleaning and exploring data using **EDA techniques**
- Building clear and simple **visualizations** with **Power BI** and similar tools
- Writing code in **Python**, **Java**, and **C**

## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Good At

- **Programming:** Python, Java, C
- **Data tools:** SQL, basic statistics
- **Problem-solving** and learning new technologies quickly

## ðŸ“š Currently Learning

I'm committed to becoming a well-rounded data professional. Right now, I'm focusing on:

- **Azure Cloud**
- **Power BI**
- Data modeling and evaluation techniques
- Building projects with real-world applications

## ðŸ’š Interested in Open Source

I truly believe in the power of **open source software (OSS)**. Sharing knowledge and collaborating with others is one of the best ways to grow â€” and Iâ€™m always looking to contribute to OSS projects, learn from the community, and give back whenever I can.

## ðŸŒ± My Goal

While Kaggle competitions are fun and a great place to learn, Iâ€™m especially excited about contributing to **real-world projects** â€” where teamwork, constraints, and impact truly shape the learning experience.
